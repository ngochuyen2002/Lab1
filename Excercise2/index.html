        <p>I taught my final course in Fall 2019. You can view a <u>video of my last lecture, </u>which was not about computer science.</p>
        <p>Khan Academy now carries <u>algorithms tutorials </u>for which <u>Devin Balkcom</u> and I produced content.</p>
        <p>Are you looking for solutions to excercises and problems in <i>Introduction to Algorithms?</i>
        <br>If you are, then see the <u>frequently asked questions and answer </u>below
        <br>If you request solutions from me, I will not respond.</p>
        <p>From July 2004 through June 2008, I was the director of the <u>Dartmouth Insitute for Writing and Rhetoric</u></p>
        <p>I occasionally taught a graduate Computer Science course on how to write papers and how to give talks. I publish a <u>list of usage rules </u>that I required my students to observe.</p>
        <p>In 2015, PRI's "The World" ran a <u>story on mentoring women in computer science </u>in which a couple of my students and I were interviewed.</p>
